# University project
Project based on hlhllh project on the paper "Learning Behaviors with Uncertain Human Feedback" : 
https://github.com/hlhllh/Learning-Behaviors-with-Uncertain-Human-Feedback.

The aim is to develop an alternative approach for the integration of a human feedback by modifying an
existing project using Learning from human feedback.

We decided to replace keyboard pressing by Speech recognition as a feedback.
